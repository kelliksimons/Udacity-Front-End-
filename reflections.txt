Your response goes here!

1.So far learning HTML has been a breeze! The way the course is setup to train you into writing the code over and over,
but not in a boring way makes it very easy to understand and manipulate.

2.Putting things together to create mockups

3.Only difficult thing for me right now is managing my time, I am a full-time student and I work part-time which I am struggling finding a consistent schedule.

4.So far, I look at what I have to accomplish, and strategize on how it should be setup. Making sure I follow each section step by step, and seeing references for help. MDN reference site is a bonus.
